This is a public repository I created in the spirit of sharing.

## Folders

### K15t/

Scope

* Atlassian Jira Software Cloud
* K15t Backbone Issue Sync for Cloud Jira add-on

Context

This folder contains public domain bash scripts that were created to quickly extract information from the K15t support zip file.  The K15t support zip file is created upon request via the Atlassian add-on's troubleshooting webpage in the Backbone Issue Sync for Cloud configuration settings.
